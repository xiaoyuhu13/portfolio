            <p>China Gourmet Longmont is a local family owned Chinese restaurant that I worked at 
                as a cashier and waitress for two years. After being hit with the COVID19, 
                China Gourmet began to take orders through delivery apps such as DoorDash. However, 
                online ordering was not availible through their website. To address this issue, my 
                coworker and I redesigned and coded a new responsive website to adapt China Gourmet to 
                the pandemic, and better express its modern brand.

                <p>
                    The original China Gourmet website included links to menus for both the Longmont and 
                    Boulder locations, which would sometimes confuse customers and cause them to order from 
                    the wrong store. This resulted in a bad experience for both customers and employees, 
                    and was especially difficult to deal with during rush hours. 
                </p>

            <div class='section'>
                <p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 4vw;"> 
                    The original menu led to a ten page pdf which was cumbersome for customers to scroll through, 
                    with hard to read text, especially on mobile. Aesthetically, the vintage style site did not 
                    match China Gourmet Longmont’s black and red logo and modern layout. Finally, the website did 
                    not include any information on how to order online, which became crucial during COVID conditions.

        <div class='content'>
            <p>Integrating my experiences interacting with customers as a waitress and cashier at China Gourmet for 3 years, and meeting with the restaurant owner and my fellow co-workers, I identified three main stakeholders that frequent the restaurant. </p>
            <div class='personas'>

            </div>
            <p>Drawing from the behaviors, frustrations, and goals of our main stakeholders, I formulated five main objectives the website must fulfill.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Easily editable menu to accomodate Nora's busy schedule and frequent changes</li>
                <li>Prominent and straightforward ordering experience for regulars</li>
                <li>Additional information and location for tourists</li>
                <li>link online ordering services need to help China Gourmet survive through the pandemic</li>
                <li>display COVID updates to ensure the safety of the customers</li>

        <p style="margin-top:-18px;font-style: italic;">Breaking Down the China Gourmet Site</p>
        <div class='content'>
            <p>Keeping these objectives in mind, I began to reinvent the China Gourmet website page by page.</p>
            <div class='section one'>
                <img class='process1' src="assets/process1.png">
                <div>
                    <h3> 1. Revamping Home Page</h3>
                    <p>
                    In early sketches I wasn’t sure how much information to place on the home page, as many local competitors displayed their hours and location, about, pictures, menu information, and more. Reviewing the main customers China Gourmet serves helped me develop the final low-fidelity prototype. To create a welcoming space for new customers, I planned informational “about” and “specials” sections, along with pictures featuring the cooking process and food. For returning customers, I placed prominent “Order” buttons on the landing page, and navigation bar for easy ordering from any page. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3 style="margin-right:3vw;"> 2. Presenting Hours-and-Location Info</h3>
                    <p style="margin-right:3vw;">
                        I made a separate “hours and location” page so customers could quickly access the information without searching through the homepage or footer. We also embedded a map, so users could see the location without opening another tab.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img class= "process2" src="assets/process2.png">

                <div class='left'>
                    <h3>3. Differentiating between Online and Phone Orders</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that China Gourmet takes both phone orders and online orders, it is important to distinguish between the two for order to be packed accurately, and inform customers that online ordering is available through the official website. To accomplish this goal and prevent user information overload, the “Order” button opens a popup that clearly illustrates these two options.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class='section four'>
                <div class='left'>
                    <h3 style="margin-right:3vw;">4. Navigable Online Menu</h3>
                    <p style="margin-right: 3vw;">
                        Making the current pdf menu both easily navigable for users and easy for Nora to edit posed a challenge. Having a dropdown menu and a web page for each menu section would be good for users, but hard for Nora to edit, while embedding a pdf would be easy for Nora to update, but tedious to navigate, especially for new customers. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img class='process4' src="assets/process4.png">
            </div>
            <p>Balancing these two stakeholders, I pulled elements from both initial solutions to create a navigable carousel made of PNGs for each menu page. With this solution Nora could easily update the specials page, and customers had access to a dropdown menu that automatically scrolled to specific menu sections. </p>

                <p>After checking in with Nora, we decided to remove the specials section, as she often changes the specials, and would not have the time to constantly update the specials on the site. Going back to the two groups of stakeholders, the immediate order buttons allow regulars to quickly order, while the “About Us” section aims to introduce the restaurant to tourists. </p>

            <p>I enjoyed working on this project because I was able to combine my experiences as a previous employee, and learnings from my first web design class, to help out a restaurant I care about. It was my first time working on a design project with a teammate, so it was nice to have someone I could get design feedback from, and work through challenges with. Through this project I learned how to collaborate on a project using github, and balance the needs of multiple stakeholders.</p>
            <p>Looking back, there are still changes that could improve the user experience. For example, the COVID information could be made permanent, rather than shown in a pop-up, so users don’t have to remember the changed regulations. Overall, I was able to step through the design process with a real world project, and take a website from ideation to launch.</p>
