        <div class='content'>
            <p>China Gourmet Longmont is a local family owned Chinese restaurant that I worked at 
                as a cashier and waitress for two years. After being hit with the COVID19, 
                China Gourmet began to take orders through delivery apps such as DoorDash. However, 
                online ordering was not availible through their website. To address this issue, my 
                coworker and I redesigned and coded a new responsive website to adapt China Gourmet to 
                the pandemic, and better express its modern brand.

                    The original China Gourmet website included links to menus for both the Longmont and 
                    Boulder locations, which would sometimes confuse customers and cause them to order from 
                    the wrong store. This resulted in a bad experience for both customers and employees, 
                    and was especially difficult to deal with during rush hours.

            <div class='section'>
                <p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 4vw;"> 
                    The original menu led to a ten page pdf which was cumbersome for customers to scroll through, 
                    with hard to read text, especially on mobile. Aesthetically, the vintage style site did not 
                    match China Gourmet Longmont’s black and red logo and modern layout. Finally, the website did 
                    not include any information on how to order online, which became crucial during COVID conditions.

            <p>Nora, the owner, is always busy managing the restaurant and her two children. However, she often changes the weekly specials, so the new menu must be easily editable for her.</p>
            <p>Situated next to a hotel, a mix regulars and tourists make up China Gourmet Longmont’s main customer base. Making ordering prominent and straightforward streamlines the experience for regulars, while adding a home page with additional information is important for tourists. Additionaly, the website should also be mobile friendly for tourists, and those ordering on the go.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, links to China Gourmet’s online ordering services and new COVID regulations need to be emphasized to help China Gourmet survive through the pandemic, and ensure the safety of the customers.</p>

                    <h3> 1. Revamping Home Page</h3>
                    <p>
                    In early sketches I wasn’t sure how much information to place on the home page, as many local competitors displayed their hours and location, about, pictures, menu information, and more. Reviewing the main customers China Gourmet serves helped me develop the final low-fidelity prototype. To create a welcoming space for new customers, I planned informational “about” and “specials” sections, along with pictures featuring the cooking process and food. For returning customers, I placed prominent “Order” buttons on the landing page, and navigation bar for easy ordering from any page.

                    <p style="margin-right:3vw;">
                        I made a separate “hours and location” page so customers could quickly access the information without searching through the homepage or footer. We also embedded a map, so users could see the location without opening another tab.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>3. Differentiating between Online and Phone Orders</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that China Gourmet takes both phone orders and online orders, it is important to distinguish between the two for order to be packed accurately, and inform customers that online ordering is available through the official website. To accomplish this goal and prevent user information overload, the “Order” button opens a popup that clearly illustrates these two options.

                </div>

                <div class='left'>
                    <h3 style="margin-right:3vw;">4. Navigable Online Menu</h3>
                    <p style="margin-right: 3vw;">
                        Making the current pdf menu both easily navigable for users and easy for Nora to edit posed a challenge. Having a dropdown menu and a web page for each menu section would be good for users, but hard for Nora to edit, while embedding a pdf would be easy for Nora to update, but tedious to navigate, especially for new customers. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img class='process4' src="assets/process4.png">
            </div>
            <p>Balancing these two stakeholders, I pulled elements from both initial solutions to create a navigable carousel made of PNGs for each menu page. With this solution Nora could easily update the specials page, and customers had access to a dropdown menu that automatically scrolled to specific menu sections. </p>

                The new aesthetic captures the contemporary Chinese eatery’s brand.  The dark grey, red, and

                <p>After checking in with Nora, we decided to remove the specials section, as she often changes the specials, and would not have the time to constantly update the specials on the site. Going back to the two groups of stakeholders, the immediate order buttons allow regulars to quickly order, while the “About Us” section aims to introduce the restaurant to tourists. </p>

                    The inclusion of China Gourmet’s online ordering partners was especially important in order adapt the restaurant to customers new ordering habits. The “View Menu” button makes the menu easily accesible for ordering. </p>

            <p>I enjoyed working on this project because I was able to combine my experiences as a previous employee, and learnings from my first web design class, to help out a restaurant I care about. It was my first time working on a design project with a teammate, so it was nice to have someone I could get design feedback from, and work through challenges with. Through this project I learned how to collaborate on a project using github, and balance the needs of multiple stakeholders.</p>
            <p>Looking back, there are still changes that could improve the user experience. For example, the COVID information could be made permanent, rather than shown in a pop-up, so users don’t have to remember the changed regulations. Overall, I was able to step through the design process with a real world project, and take a website from ideation to launch.</p>
