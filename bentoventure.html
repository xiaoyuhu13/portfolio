            <p>As a part of the Design Methodologies class at UC Berkeley, I worked on a semester-long UX 
                research project to create a solution for our assigned prompt of “how might we reduce cooking 
                time?”. As a team we conceptualized Bentoventure, a bento box that creates a fun and 
                independent lunch packing experience for children by immersing  them in a bento box theme with
                 a specific scavenger hunt prompt for each bento compartment. I conducted 2 out of the 8 
                 one-on-one interviews that informed our design process, and created the themes and scavenger 
                 prompts used in the final bento box design.

        </div>
        <div class='content'>
            <p>Many parents do not have the time or energy to pack their children lunch each day. 
                These children end up waiting in long lunch lines at school that reduce their lunch
                 time with friends, or eating unhealthy pre-packaged foods such as Lunchables or school
                  vending-machine snacks. To further understand the problem space, my teammates and I 
                  interviewed a total of 8 families with elementary and middle school aged children.</p>

            <h3>1:1 Interviews</h3>
            <p>
            To prepare for our interviews, my team and I first created an interview template with eight different sections: background information, time component of preparing lunch, children’s interests, usual lunch components, COVID changes, health of lunch, financial cost, and safety concerns. We decided to use semi-structured one on one interviews and draw from the questions we developed to guide our interviews along the right path while still retaining some flexibility to dig deeper into different insights from each family.

                <div>
                    <p><strong>I interviewed two families with children aged 10-15, and synthesized the information into the following main takeaways.</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Parents' goal lunch for their children is a fresh, well-balanced, filling meal</p></li>
                        <li><p>Parents mostly pack lunches the night before, so lunch foods should be able to last a night and half a day in children’s lunchboxes</p></li>
                        <li><p>Packing a snack in addition to lunch is required from some schools, and a important part of the lunch packing procedure</p>
                        </li>

                    <h3>Observation Pictures</h3>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the research insights that my team and I gained, I also collected several observation pictures of typical house and apartment kitchens and food preparation spaces. From these pictures I found that counters and stoves might be hard to reach for younger children, and some participants used the dining area of their house to prepare food if the kitchen was too busy or small.  Taking this into account, I proposed that our solution should be mobile so it can be used on lower surfaces that children can reach, outside or inside of the kitchen.

                        Compiling all of our user research findings, and analysis of competitor strengths and weaknesses we produced a VOA chart and the following must-haves for our solution.

                    <ol>
                        <li><p>The product must be safe for children to use</p></li>
                        <li><p>The product must be or make food presentable or appealing for children to use multiple times</p></li>
                        <li><p>The product must be or promote healthiness in food choices for children</p></li>
                        <li><p>The product must motivate and develop independence in children</p></li>

            <p>We also refined our how might we statement to reflect our target user group of families with elementary aged children more accurately.  “How might we make the process of making homemade school lunches an independent activity for young school-aged children?”</p>

                        After each coming up with ten individual concepts using methods learned in class such as biomimicry and forced analogy, we then met as a group to complete the 3-12-3 concept generation activity. This method allowed us to build off each other’s ideas and quickly iterate through several rounds of concept generation, resulting in a total of around 60 concepts.

                    <h3>2. Concept Selection</h3>
                    <p style="margin-right:3vw;">
                        We began our concept selection process by placing all our ideas on a positioning chart with level of independency, and level of technology as our axis. This allowed us to determine if our concepts were feasible, and met our must have of “child must be able to use product independently”.  We were left with 15 concepts after eliminating outliers and combining similar concepts together, which we then reduced to 8 through Borda count voting.

                        After comparing our final 7 concepts on a pugh chart with school lunch as our datum, we discovered that our final concepts were focused on helping elementary school age children create their own lunches independently, rather than reducing cooking time for parents, which led to our final revised how might we of“How might we promote the independent creation of healthy school lunches by elementary school aged children across all socio-economic spectrums?”
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Guided by our final how might we and a group discussion, choose four final concepts to prototype Bento box scavenger hunt, Automatic sandwich maker, bread cutter in fun shapes, and social media lunchtime app for parents and children.</p>
            <div class='section four'>
                <h3>3. Prototyping</h3>
                <p>
                 We each prototyped one of the final four concepts. I created a mid-fidelity physical prototype of the bento box scavenger hunt with tupperware containers based on my original low-fidelity concept sketch. The mid fidelity prototype consisted of several small tupperware containers nested in a single large container. I envisioned exchangeable lids with prompts such as “find a blue fruit” engraved on them to form multiple lunch combinations.

                After we each pitched our prototypes to the rest of the team, we selected the bento box scavenger hunt as our final concept, renaming it Bentoventure to capture the adventurous scavenger hunt aspect of building your own lunch with a bento box.
